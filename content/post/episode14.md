### [Civ 6 Releases February 9th Only NVIDIA cards for now.](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/early-exclusive-civilization-vi-to-release-february-9th-for-linux-with-a-discount-nvidia-only-for-now.9052) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>

For the multiplayer side, Aspyr Media have confirmed that the Linux version will be compatible with the Mac version. Neither will currently be compatible with Windows, I will have more about that in my interview with them which will be published after the release.

Due to the delay, they will also be releasing the Linux version along with a discount on all versions of the game.

### [Rapid Collapse of Patent Aggressors’ Patent Strategy: Creative, Microsoft, RPX, LinkedIn, and Fitbit](http://www.techrights.org/2017/02/05/patent-bubble-strategy/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@secureshellv2](https://twitter.com/secureshellv2)</small>

The fantasy which is building a company on a foundation of patent revenue (like a patent troll) is quickly going away, as even some of the most notorious patent aggressors (companies that are failing in the real market and thus turn to patents) begrudgingly and inevitably find out.

### [DIY Linux Laptop the Olimex Teres 1](http://www.zdnet.com/article/diy-linux-laptop-build-your-own-for-240-with-fully-open-source-olimex-teres-i/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>

Bulgarian open-source hardware outfit Olimex has released the final designs and components for DIY fans to build their own modular Linux laptop.

Buyers have two choices for their machine. Devoted DIY builders can download Olimex's CAD files for building the Teres I on its GitHub page, which offer schematics for hardware components such as printed circuit boards (PCB), keyboard and so forth, as well as all the Linux software components necessary to operate the hardware.

The other option is to buy the semi-finished Teres 1 laptop for €224 ($240), which is shipped as a kit that buyers assemble themselves.

### [A Patch for P-State on Kaby Lake Processors](https://phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=P-State-Kabylake-Patching) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>

There are complaints of performance issues, when busy workloads are executed on Kaby Lake desktop systems. Even 100% busy workload will not lead to max turbo frequency with default energy performance setting. 

The reason for this is that OEM's decided to turn on energy efficiency optimization feature. When this is enabled, an optimum energy efficient max P-State is calculated based on the current energy performance preference setting. This is good for performance/watt, but this will result in some loss of performance. 

This change disables this energy efficiency optimization feature for Kaby Lake desktop CPU models in HWP mode only as these systems tend to care more about performance than power.
