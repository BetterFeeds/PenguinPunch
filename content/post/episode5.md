[7 Ways Linux Users Differ from Windows Users](http://www.datamation.com/open-source/7-ways-linux-users-differ-from-windows-users.html)
> Linux users are different from Windows users in attitude as much as their choice of operating system. Originating as a Unix-type operating system and in opposition to Windows, Linux has developed an expectation and a philosophy in direct opposition to those promoted by Windows.

>I love linux, and I love strategy games, so I am pretty excited that there are 3 new strategy games coming to Linux. Looks like the folks at Feral Interactive are porting Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Chaos Rising and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Retribution. Both look like a great play, and the Warhammer universe is something that I would love to get more into.
>
>If science fiction and orks don't do it for you, then there is also Cossaks 3 on it's way. I really enjoy a good historical strategy game, and this one can have as many as 10,000 units on map at a time. 
>
>If making a game is more your speed, then the people of Clickteam have done you a favor. They have announced that Fusion 3 will be supporting Linux and BSD. So take a look at it when it releases and make a few more Linux games.

>
> And TechCrunch’s Signe Brewster, in a write up of her experience in the same vehicle, says she “came away from my ride trusting the technology. The self-driving car detected obstacles, people and even potholes, and responded intelligently.“

[How to Effectively and Efficiently Edit Configuration Files in Linux](https://www.linux.com/learn/how-effectively-and-efficiently-edit-configuration-files-linux)
>Every Linux administrator has to eventually (and manually) edit a configuration file. Whether you are setting up a web server, configuring a service to connect to a database, tweaking a bash script, or troubleshooting a network connection, you cannot avoid a dive deep into the heart of one or more configuration files. To some, the prospect of manually editing configuration files is akin to a nightmare. Wading through what seems like countless lines of options and comments can put you on the fast track for hair and sanity loss.

[US Gives Away the Internet](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37527719)
> It's a move being breathlessly described by some as the US "giving up the internet" to the likes of China, Russia and the Middle East.

### Devcon Review
> Mat talks bout his recent visit to DEVCON. 

### Ohio Linux Fest 
OCTOBER 7-8 AT THE HYATT REGENCY COLUMBUS, OHIO.

Mat Speaks on OCT 7TH 2:00PM in FRANKLIN A
> I Don’t Git It 
How do I use git? What is a commit? Why are we using forks instead of spoons? What is version control? In this talk, I will be demonstrating how to use git (no prior knowledge necessary) as well as why to use git and, almost more importantly, when NOT to use git. I’ll be speaking with a focus on how you can take this knowledge to contribute to open source projects and there will be a demo making a contribution to an open source project on GitHub. By the end of this session, you will be able to start using git in your own projects as well as beginning to contribute to others.
