The company has been working on a platform called SUSE Container as a Service Platform. SUSE CaaSP puts together SUSE Linux Enterprise MicroOS, a variant of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server optimized for running Linux containers (also in development), and container orchestration software based on Kubernetes.

### [Handbrake's video conversion app update was 13 years in the making](https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/27/handbrake-transcoder-app-update/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@secureshell](https://twitter.com/secureshellv2)</small>

In the fast-moving world of modern app development, users can often wait days or a small number of weeks for an update. However, if you're the team behind Handbrake -- one of the world's most popular video conversion apps -- years can pass before you're ready to show off what you've been working on. Well, 13 years to be exact. After more than a decade in development and available as a beta release, the Handbrake team has released version 1.0.0 of its transcoding software, which delivers a much-needed set of new features.

I've been using Discord for a while now, it's a great chat / VoIP app with a good company and community behind it. They've had a "canary" client for Linux for a while but it felt unsupported glad to see they've been releasing updates!

### [Worlds Thinnest Computer](https://fossbytes.com/intel-compute-card/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@pylogix](https://twitter.com/pylogix)</small>

At CES 2017, Intel unveiled its thinnest and smallest computer named Compute Card. This full-blown computer looks like a thicker credit card, and comes loaded with 7th Gen Intel Kaby Lake CPU and other PC components. Intel has partnered with many companies to make the device upgrades easier. It can be inserted into smart appliances, all-in-one PCs, drones, robots, etc. Compute Card is expected to hit the markets in mid-2017.

### [PlayStation 4 Running Linux Can Now Use AMDGPU-PRO With Vulkan](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=PlayStation4-Vulkan-AMDGPU) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@secureshell](https://twitter.com/secureshellv2)</small>

The work to run Linux on the PlayStation 4 continues to advance and previously we reported on those behind it managing to exploit the Radeon graphics found on the AMD APU powering the PS4. The latest milestone is they now have Vulkan running on the PS4.

### [A website that features the most neglected of commands: man](http://manpage.io/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>

The man command gives users access to a huge number of detailed manual documentation pages for the packages in their system.

Unfortunately, they are often forgotten about or neglected. It is easy to forget that you might have the answer right there on your machine and you don't need to Google for it each time.

Manpage.io aims to help more people read and learn from this great source. We want to be the best place to view and share manpages online by presenting them on a nice clean website with plenty of anchor links to reference different sections and flags directly.

### [Endless is bringing it's cheap user friendly PC's to the US](http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/4/14148034/endless-cheap-linux-pc-mission-ces-2017) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>

The dream of a Linux computer for normal humans is relatively dead. Sure, Google put Linux in billions of hands and homes with Android and Chrome OS, but neither OS is very much like the desktop Linux flavors well-meaning open-source developers have been crafting for decades.

A company called Endless has marked a third route, a stripped-down Linux operating system without many of the complications and difficulties (and features) of a typical Linux distro, but more apps and offline capabilities than Chrome OS. The OS is available for free download, but it also ships on the quirky Endless Mini and Endless One desktops Endless sells.

RENAULT have created a new electric vehicle that allows third party companies to copy and modify existing software to completely customise it.

### [A REST API written in Bash.](https://hackernoon.com/a-web-service-written-in-pure-bash-2af847902df1#.ism1q5eme) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>

At @carrot we build out many APIs using Go and Node some of which are hosted on DigitalOcean and take advantage of Docker containers, but we also use the Amazon Stack, like Lambda, S3, and Cloudfront with Apex & Serverless. We have many tools to help us startup projects, like Spike when developing static sites or ash-github when setting up a repository on Github. While working on ash-github I joked about how everything should be written in bash. The more my coworkers and I joked about it, the more the idea grew in my head and soon the idea came to fruition.

### [Civ 6 will be coming to Linux!](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/exclusive-civilization-vi-now-fully-confirmed-to-be-coming-for-steamos-linux-and-soon-too.8860?utm_content=buffer0c90d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@Secureshellv2](https://twitter.com/secureshellv2)</small>

I cannot confirm to you the actual release date, but I can confirm if everything goes as planned that you wonâ€™t be kept waiting much longer.

Aspyr Media ported the game to Mac not too long after the Windows release, but Linux gamers had been left waiting as Aspyr stated they were still checking the "feasibility" of a port to get it up to scratch. I've seen a lot of people claim Aspyr had "abandoned" us and other interesting things, but clearly not! I did previously state it was clear that Linux was firmly in their minds, as they were repeatedly mentioning the Linux version in tweets.

### [Mac Marketshare Falls to Five Year Low](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3155088/apple-mac/macs-share-falls-to-five-year-low.html) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>

The Mac's 6.1% user share in December was the lowest mark recorded by Net Applications since August 2011, more than five years ago. Although the Mac number fluctuates month to month -- as do all estimates from the metrics firm -- its general trend has been up for two-thirds of a decade: In 2009, for example, the Mac accounted for only about 5% of all personal computers.

User share does not equal sales -- the former resembles the installed base more than anything -- but Apple's own data fits the view of a shrinking Mac. In October, the company reported sales of 4.9 million Macs for the September quarter, a 14% year-over-year decline and the fourth straight quarterly downturn.

### [From OSX to Ubuntu](https://nicolas.perriault.net/code/2016/from-osx-to-ubuntu/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>

A year earlier I decided to switch from OSX to Ubuntu, so now is a good time to make a little retrospective. TL;DR: Linux now offers a pleasant desktop user experience and there's no way back for me.

## Deep Dive
### [What will it take to make this the year of Linux Desktop?](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3152017/linux/how-can-linux-get-5-percent-desktop-market-share.html)



The guys dig into why every year we call this is the year of linux, and why that is never true. But what would it take to make that true? What are we missing? What are we not doing that will push us over the edge of beaing able to really proclaim this is the year of linux, and it be true this time?
