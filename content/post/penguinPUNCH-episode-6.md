[Maintainers Matter](http://kmkeen.com/maintainers-matter/)
> The promise: Sandboxing makes you immune to bad ISVs.
> 
> The reality: It protects you from some things and not others. App Stores have proven that ISVs will try to get away with as much abusive behavior as possible. Sandboxing protects against many threats, but does not suddenly make people ethical. Distributions with human maintainers are more likely to make mistakes than an OS-enforced sandbox, but human maintainers are also more likely to sniff out the dumb stunts that ISVs try to pull. No human maintainer is ever going to willingly package a flashlight app which phones home. From source anyway.
