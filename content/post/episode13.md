What’s Next for GIMP
There are still many bugs to fix before we can release 2.10. In the mean time, we are planning to hold a week long developers meet-up in Barcelona at end of January. One of the topics will be cleaning up libgimp to get it into the releasable state for 2.10. We shall soon announce the full agenda for the Wilberweek.

Meet Arch Anywhere, a new open-source project created by developer Dylan Schacht to help Arch Linux newcomers install the powerful and modern Linux-based operating system on their personal computers, or a virtual machine. [Download The Iso](https://arch-anywhere.org/download/)

Arch Linux is an open-source, lightweight and highly customizable computer operating system that follows a rolling release model for its updates and security patches, allowing users to transform new installations into anything they want, such as state-of-the-art server or reliable workstation. But installing Arch Linux is not for everyone!

### [Mycroft releases raspberry pi image!](https://mycroft.ai/mycroft-now-available-raspberry-pi-image/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>

Mycroft now has a Raspberry Pi image that is ready to run.   Developers, makers, hackers and enthusiasts can [download the image](https://rebrand.ly/Picroft-0_8) to their Raspberry Pi and create their own Mycroft enabled projects.

We have created the Picroft image so the community has access to a quick, easy to install artificial intelligence(AI).   Our thinking is that having ready access to an out-of-the-box AI will inspire some crazy cool applications.  We’re hoping our community proves us right.

Lavabit has resurrected itself from the ashes to once again provide secure email services in a post-Snowden world.

Ladar Levison, CEO and owner of Lavabit, chose the US Inauguration Day to announce the firm's relaunch, saying in a statement to users that the email service will once again become available in order to protect "freedom, justice, and liberty," as secured by the US Constitution.

### [Raspberry Pi imitator has GbE, 2GB RAM, and 4K video](linuxgizmos.com/raspberry-pi-imitator-has-gbe-2gb-ram-and-4k-video/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@secureshell](https://twitter.com/secureshellv2)</small>

Asus has launched a RPi-like “Tinker Board” that runs Debian and Kodi on a quad-core 1.8GHz -A17 RK3288, and offers 2GB RAM, GbE, 4K video, and 40-pin GPIO.

The rumored Asus Tinker Board is finally for sale at Farnell in the UK, with a footprint, layout, and features that are very close to that of the Raspberry Pi, including the much copied 40-pin expansion connector and a Debian Linux image. The quad-core SoC and onboard wireless further reminds one of the Raspberry Pi 3.

### [Beginner's guide to IRC](https://fedoramagazine.org/beginners-guide-irc/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>

Before joining any IRC channels, you should understand basic manners online. Joining a channel is like attending a party at someone’s home. Good manners on IRC are as important as good manners when visiting someone in real life. If you show up and behave rudely, you’ll probably be asked to leave, or even be banned. Be polite, and assume the other people in the channel also have good intentions — especially if you don’t understand something they say.

It’s also important to know how people have conversations in IRC. Often a channel has more than one conversation going at a time. Again, like a party, sometimes conversations overlap, so it’s important to remember a comment may not be directed to you.

To avoid confusion, people in a conversation often use each other’s IRC nicks to indicate to whom they’re talking. The nick is followed by a colon or a comma, and then the comment. Most IRC clients also understand this rule, and notify you if someone uses your name this way.

### [Intel compute card already has a friend](http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/19/14329102/nexdock-intel-compute-card-modular-computer-concept) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@pylogix](https://twitter.com/pylogix)</small>

Intel announced the Compute Card at CES 2017 a few weeks ago. It’s a credit card-sized device that’s essentially a full computer, complete with CPU, GPU, and wireless connectivity. It’s designed to let hardware manufacturers easily add computer internals to smart devices, all built around a single, upgradable standard.

### [Calamares 3.0 Universal Linux Installer Released, Drops Support for KPMcore 2](http://news.softpedia.com/news/calamares-3-0-universal-linux-installer-released-drops-support-for-kpmcore-2-512055.shtml) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@secureshell](https://twitter.com/secureshellv2)</small>

Calamares, the open-source distribution-independent system installer, which is used by many GNU/Linux distributions, including the popular KaOS, Netrunner, Chakra GNU/Linux, and recently KDE Neon, was updated today to version 3.0.

Calamares 3.0 is a major milestone, ending the support for the 2.4 series, which recently received its last maintenance update, versioned 2.4.6, bringing numerous improvements, countless bug fixes, and some long-anticipated features, including a brand-new PythonQt-based module interface.

### [Mir Year in Review](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/01/17/mir-2016-end-of-year-review/)

Looking forward to 2017 
As mentioned above, 2017 will see a cleanup of our “toolkit” API and better support for “platform” plugin modules. We will then be working on upstreaming our mesa patch. That will allow us to release our (currently experimental) Vulkan support.

We’ve also been working on reducing latency but the big wins didn’t quite make the end of 2016. There’s a snapshot of progress here.

As we complete these changes, 2017 will see a Mir 1.0 release.

## The Deep Dive

How GNU R U?

Should we care about using only "free as in freedom" software? Should all strive to be like Richard Stallman? The guys hash out this age old question in this week's deep dive.
