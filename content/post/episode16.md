### [Anbox Lets you run Android apps as native Linux desktop apps](https://liliputing.com/2017/04/anbox-lets-run-android-apps-natively-ubuntu-gnulinux-distros.html)

Want to run Android apps on a PC? Developers have been offering emulators like BlueStacks and Genymotion for years. But for the most part those applications set up a virtual machine that isolates your entire Android experience from the rest of your operating system.

Anbox is a new open source system that lets you run Android apps on a PC natively, as if they were desktop applications. There’s no emulation required.

### [Effectively using Android without Google Play Services with gplayweb in Docker](https://fxaguessy.fr/en/articles/2017/02/11/effectively-using-android-without-google-play-services-gplayweb-in-docker/)

There are many good reasons of using Android without Google Play Services (the Google's proprietary part of Android operating system), mostly to protect its privacy. Google Play Services contain background processes used by Google not only to provide services (e.g., push notifications, accurate geolocation combining GPS, Wi-Fi and GSM, application installations and updates…) but also to track the device usage (location, used applications, permanent connection to Google servers...).

### [Shuttleworth returns as Canonical CEO after major changes to Ubuntu](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/12/80_canonical_staff_face_chop/)

Exclusive More than 80 Canonical workers are facing the axe as founder Mark Shuttleworth has taken back the role of chief executive officer.

The number, revealed today by The Reg, comes as Shuttleworth assumed the position from CEO of eight years Jane Silber, previously chief operating officer.

The Reg has learned 31 or more staffers have already left the Ubuntu Linux maker ahead of Shuttleworth's rise, with at least 26 others now on formal notice and uncertainty surrounding the remainder.

### [Rebble.io](http://rebble.io)

Welcome to the first Rebble Community Update of 2017! Please peruse our paraphrased prospectus of progress over the preceding period. If you’d like to add something, send us a tweet, or better still, submit a pull request! :bowtie:

It’s been over a month since our last update, though the lack of updates here belies the tremendous strides made across myriad projects! While our early efforts concentrated heavily on investigation and reverse engineering, often manifesting as wiki pages and rough proofs of concept, many projects are starting to mature into tangible, viable entities. The Rebble Store now has a live, functional front end, with the required back end to support it well underway. Firmware has moved beyond emulation and onto real hardware, with promising demos on both Pebble Time and Pebble Steel. Replacement graphics libraries and fonts are being scratch-built for inclusion in upcoming firmware. There have even been pics posted of what appears to be some kind of new Pebble-esque prototype! Details, source code links, videos, and more below… :rocket:

### [Snap now supported in Fedora 24+](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/04/11/snap-support-lands-in-fedora-24-25-26)

As part as our mission to get snaps running everywhere, we are pleased to announce that support for snaps has now officially landed in Fedora, starting with Fedora 24 and up.

### [Nextcloud scanning people's owncloud and nextcloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/5ybmf1/nextcloud_scanning_peoples_owncloud_and_nextcloud/)

Just a heads up for anyone hosting an owncloud or nextcloud instance on a home connection, be aware that Nextcloud has been scanning ips for nextcloud -or- owncloud instances, logging vulnerabilities, and sending notices to various government security agencies, such as the BSI in Germany (I don't know what the listed agencies portfolios are, but "security organizations" was nextcloud's term from their announcement below). The agencies have been filing abuse reports with ISPs about the users (a sample linked below). Several users reported getting shutoff threats from their ISPs in the thread below.
