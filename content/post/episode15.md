A script to completely take over a running Linux system remotely, allowing you to log into an in-memory rescue environment, unmount the original root filesystem, and do anything you want, all without rebooting. Replace one distro with another without touching a physical console.

### [AppCenter, another big push by Elementary OS to define themselves](https://medium.com/elementaryos/building-the-future-of-elementary-os-9df3fa940b67#.648uw5axt) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>

Each version of elementary OS has been made available for the price of “pay-what-you-want.” We strongly believe in making sure that developers can secure funding for their work, but we also recognize that not everyone can afford a single market value for software.

We are excited to announce that every app in AppCenter will be be able to be made available for pay-what-you-want.

### [Dexter: the robotic arm to end scarcity](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/51496107/dexter-the-robotic-arm-to-end-scarcity?ref=nav_search) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@secureshellv2](https://twitter.com/secureshellv2)</small>

Our goal is to empower people to build what they want when they need it. We believe this can be done by creating an automation technology sharing community that owns all of the necessary building blocks to realize a complete personal micro-factory. To this end we have created an efficient, precise, brilliant, sensitive, extensible, buildable,  and programmable 5+ axes motion platform (a robot arm we affectionately call Dexter).  We have shared all of the source code and manufacturing data under the most permissible open source license (GPL3). What we are trying to do with this Kickstarter project is to find the first tier of collaborators. If you have a passion for robotics and automation, making and tinkering, 3D printing and programming, or you just want to build your own home business building robots, join us.

### [Build your own Linux Distro](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-create-your-own-linux-distribution-with-yocto-on-ubuntu/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@pylogix](https://twitter.com/pylogix)</small>

Here is how you can build your own creation of a minimal Linux distribution using the Yocto project on the Ubuntu platform. The Yocto project is very famous in the embedded Linux world because of its flexibility and ease of use.  The purpose of the Yocto project is to create a Linux distro for manufacturers of embedded hardware and software. A new minimal Linux distro will be created for qemu as the (qemu is a basic software emulator) target machine and we will run it in qemu.

### [How To Build Linux Packages For Multiple Platforms Easily](https://www.ostechnix.com/build-linux-packages-multiple-platforms-easily/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@secureshellv2](https://twitter.com/secureshellv2)</small>

There are numerous Linux distributions, and packaging applications for different Linux distributions are quite time consuming and difficult task. Packaging applications is not a piece of cake for everyone. Luckily, there is an alternative and easiest way to build packages. Meet Fpm (Effing package management), a command-line program that helps to easily build packages. You can also convert a package to different format, so that the packages can be installed on different kind of Linux operating systems. And yes, Ubuntu’s Snaps and flatpaks are rapidly growing and they can be installed on most Linux distributions. But, just in case you want to package an application, Fpm is one way to do it. And, it is lot easier than traditional packaging methods. Fpm is completely free, open source tool written using ~~Ruby~~ Garbage programming language.
