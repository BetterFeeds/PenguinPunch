Justin and Jason go for duet in this week's episode and cover a lot of cool topics including how and why you should consider making Linux your career.

[Microsoft really does love Linux](http://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2016/9/15/12926288/microsoft-really-does-love-linux)

>  It's a stunning turnaround that's now backed up by Microsoft's serious attention to the open source world. Microsoft is now the top organization with the most open source contributors on Github. It beats Facebook, Docker, Google, Apache, and many other competitors.

[Five Linux Server Distros Worth Checking Out](http://windowsitpro.com/industry/five-linux-server-distros-worth-checking-out)
>Pretty much any of the nearly 300 Linux distributions you'll find listed on Distrowatch can be made to work as servers. Since Linux's earliest days, users have been provisioning "all purpose" distributions such as Slackware, Debian and Gentoo to do heavy lifting as servers for home and business. That may be fine for the hobbyist, but its a lot of unnecessary work for the professional.

[Run Arch on your Windows](http://www.techworm.net/2016/09/can-now-run-arch-linux-windows-using-awsl.html)
> Now, Microsoft has come up with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), which will not only provide a lab for the hacking experts who want to see how far they can push the WSL but also an opportunity for the software giant to try and appeal Linux devs into making themselves comfortable in Windows.

>WSL uses Ubuntu as the basis for its kernel and user space by default, although the primary subsystem is in theory distribution-agnostic. It just translates Linux system calls into their Windows counterparts or offers emulation when there isn’t a 1:1 match. As a result, ALWSL needs to do very little on its own to make Arch Linux work.

[I Have Been Linuxing Since Before you Were Born](https://opensource.com/life/16/7/my-linux-story-carla-schroder)
>Once upon a time, there was no Linux. No, really! It did not exist. It was not like today, with Linux everywhere. There were multiple flavors of Unix, there was Apple, and there was Microsoft Windows.

[NetBeans Going to Apache: Is Java Next?](http://devproconnections.com/development/netbeans-going-apache-java-next)
>Most followers of open source probably weren't surprised by Wednesday's fuss over NetBeans' possible move from Oracle to the Apache Software Foundation. If you missed it, it started with an announcement on the NetBeans website that "Oracle has proposed contributing the NetBeans IDE as a new open-source project within the Apache Incubator."

## The Deep Dive
[Linux in the job Market](http://linuxsurvival.com/the-linux-job-market/)
> First, I checked the Robert Half Technology 2016 Salary Guide. It says systems administrators make $67,500 – $107,500 (a 5.3% increase from 2015). That salary range is for general sysadmins, but if they have Linux skills, then they earn an 8% premium.
> Next, I checked Indeed.com, which gives salary estimates for US job postings. It says that 82% of Linux-related jobs in the US have a salary above $70,000 and 44% have a salary above $100,000.
