#### Open Discussion and News

[iPad only is the new Linux Desktop](https://medium.com/@chipotlecoyote/ipad-only-is-the-new-desktop-linux-de88b61b6d99#.wo6ped6wk)

> Using iOS as your primary OS is like using desktop Linux.
> 
> No, hear me out. See, Linux users don’t care how much easier we say it is in our non-Linux worlds. Sure, they say it’s because of open access and free as in scotch ale and yadda yadda yadda, but really? They like the challenge. Figuring out how to do what they used to do on a Mac or Windows PC is part of the allure.

[TypeScript is getting the love, Open Source <3's Microsoft?](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10011)

> I love what you've done with VS Code and TypeScript - that's dream come true for me! Thank you!
>
> I am sure there are other people who contributed to that but for me you Mr. Anders represent all awesome coding tools like Delphi, C# and now TypeScript.
>
> Thank you for existing!

#### Distro Review of the Month

[Linx Mint 18](https://www.linuxmint.com/)

Jusitn and Mat have been rocking Mint 18 for about two weeks. Now they are going to share their thoughts.  Some other Linux podcasts have reviewed Mint 18 and have put Mat in a mood

#### Big Discussion

*What is Big Data and how does it Linux?*

The guys interview Chas Busenburg a budding Data Scientist, who comes to explain what the heck is "Big Data" and how is Linux being used in this field.

What is hadoop?
What is a DataFrame?

note: most data scientists don't deal with server management as much as data architecture, collection and analysis. So this is a little bit about problems that need to be solved by a team who works with big data. Data Science is a buzzword right now, and I sometimes dont think people realize how many people are involved with these processes.
1. Problems Big Data Presents
 * Creating an extensible environment.
 * ETL to analysis nodes.
 * management of legacy data
 * The growing presence of noSQL databases.
2. Solutions to Problems.
 * Azure HDInsight - Microsoft partnered with Canonical using Ubuntu to run its big data service. ( Technically, it also has Microsoft server options as well, but lets be honest here.) Looks a lot like Hortonworks.
* RHEL - Red Hat has some very cool stuff going on with OpenStack , take a look at Project Sahara.
* Linux in general offers 
  * scalability
  * flexibilty
  * lower costs
  * ability to work among many tools.
  

3. Moving past the data itself.
 * Apache Spark
 * Hadoop
 * Apache Storm
 * R, Python, and Scala

4. Advice from what I have learned.
 * learn your way around a terminal
 * bash scripts will be a good friend.
 * learn to use docker or another vm software.
