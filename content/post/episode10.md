There are multiple terminal emulators you can find on the Linux platform today, with each of them offering users some remarkable features.

But sometimes, we find it difficult to choose which terminal emulator to work with, depending on our preferences. In this overview, we shall cover one exciting terminal emulator for Linux called Terminix.

### [An Ode to Desktop Linux Users](https://levlaz.org/an-ode-to-linux-desktop-users-everywhere/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>

While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because people who are crazy enough to think that they can run Linux on the desktop, are the ones who change the world.

### [Helium Rain, a realistic UE4 space simulation game is coming to Linux in 2017, looks brilliant](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/helium-rain-a-realistic-space-simulation-game-is-coming-to-linux-in-2017-looks-brilliant.8717) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@secureshellv2](https://twitter.com/secureshellv2)</small>

The developers of Helium Rain sent word that their realistic space simulation game will fully support Linux at launch. The main developer is also using Linux to make the game.

They have put up the source code on github, so anyone can go take a look. I think that’s pretty awesome to do (on top of reaching out to us directly).

### [New Smartwatch OS shows up on GITHUB](http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/84154.html?rss=1) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@pylogix](https://twitter.com/pylogix)</small>

"Many users believe that the current proprietary platforms can not guarantee a satisfactory level of control over their privacy and hardware," noted Revest, who has been working on his OS for two years. "Hence, I noticed a need for an open wearable platform and AsteroidOS is my attempt to address this issue."

### [A neovim update](https://neovim.io/news/2016/11/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>


**Progress**
What did Neovim contributors accomplish since 2014?

By a conservative estimate at least 20,000 new lines of C code have been written. We’ve written 2200 new tests, in addition to passing Vim’s own test suite. 273 different people have contributed to the core project. The core project has more commits in 3 years than Vim in 12 years.

**EOF**
So that was 2016 for Neovim. Could 2017 be the Year of the Neovim Desktop?

Neovim’s ideas are finding their way into other projects, such as Xi editor and Vim itself, which has seen more activity this year than any other year in its history.

There’s a beehive of activity in the gitter and IRC channels (which are bridged by matrix thanks to @leonerd!). Visit us to talk about the project.

And don’t forget there’s a roadmap at neovim.io if you want to check where the project is headed.

### [Top open source conference picks for 2017](https://opensource.com/article/16/12/2017-top-open-source-conference-picks) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@secureshellv2](https://twitter.com/secureshellv2)</small>

Many of you reading this will be fans of open source who would love to get out and meet open source leaders, companies, and users at conferences. With most of us having to prioritize conferences either due to budgetary or family reasons (or both), knowing which events we should prioritize can be difficult.

I have spent my career treading the boards from conference to conference all over the world, so I figured I would share some of the conferences that I would heartily recommend for 2017.
