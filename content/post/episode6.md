# Penguin Punch Episode 6 

## Open Discussion

[Red Hat Makes Ansible Galaxy Open Source](http://devproconnections.com/development/red-hat-makes-ansible-galaxy-open-source)

> DevOps just got a little easier for some, now that Red Hat has open sourced Ansible Galaxy, Ansible's official community hub for sharing Ansible Roles.
>
> In announcing the move on Tuesday, Tim Cramer, Red Hat's head of Ansible engineering, said, "Open source communities are where innovation happens. The Ansible community is thriving, and Red Hat hopes that by open sourcing the Ansible Galaxy code repository, we will be able to advance open source automation technology, and specifically Ansible Galaxy, in new and interesting ways."

[Disney goes open source](http://disney.github.io/)

> Disney has released a LOT of Open Source software recently and it's all based around messing with graphics / 3d animation. This is awesome and will be a big boon to already popular OSS projects like Blender.

Pylogix
[The Opensource Musician](https://opensource.com/life/16/10/mod-duo-multiple-guitar-stomp-boxes-single-device)

> A guitar stomp box that comes loaded with different effects and sounds. Instead of buying the multitude of guitar pedals that many musicians string together in complex, if somewhat beautiful ways, the MOD Duo negates all that. It is a single box and what's more, it is powered by open source.

[Linux Directories Explained](http://www.2daygeek.com/linux-directory-structure-file-system-hierarchy/#)

> Are you new to Linux ? If so, I would advise you to understand the Linux Directory Structure (File System Hierarchy) first. Don’t panic/scare after seeing the below image (File System Hierarchy). Getting confusion about /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin & /usr/sbin don’t worry, we are here to teach you like a baby

[XFS has super CoW powers!](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/577e11/xfs_has_gained_super_cow_powers_almost/)

> This is a reddit post by /u/anatolya 
> XFS is adding a some Copy on Write features which will allow it to add some deuplication functionality and various other data integrity checks. It won't be able to do online dedup like ZFS (due to RAM requirements and XFS not wanting to incur those penalties) but offline dedup will be possible now.

[Linus Torvalds says ARM just doesn't look like beating Intel](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/10/linus_torvalds_says_arm_just_doesnt_look_like_beating_intel/)

> Linus Torvalds believes ARM has little chance of usurping x86, because the latter has built an open hardware ecosystem that the former just doesn't look like replicating.
>
> Torvalds voiced his opinions in a fireside chat with David Rusling, chief technology officer of ARM tools vendor Linaro, at the end of September.
>
> Rusling asked Torvalds if he has a favourite architecture and Torvalds quickly responded that “x86 is still the one I favour most and that is because of the PC. The infrastructure is there there and it is open in a way no other architecture is.”

[Ubuntu releases kernel live patching to the Ubuntu community](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2016-October/000214.html)

> Ubuntu now has live patching (security update the kernel without a reboot) and as a community user you can enable this feature on up to 3 machines for free using a snap! This is huge for IoT and Mobile devices.
> I feel it's important to note that this is a feature of the 4.4 Linux Kernel and not necessarily something Canonical developed. The service they are offering simply automates the process much like Redhat's similiar but more expensive service.

[Charlie Reisinger: FOSS in Education Proponent…and Practitioner](http://fossforce.com/2016/10/charlie-reisinger-foss-education-proponent-practitioner/)

> Resinger figures that by using free and open source platforms such as Moodle and WordPress instead of proprietary options, his school district is saving something like $40,000 a year. As the clickbait headline might read, what he said next will amaze you.

[Opensource users who have never contributed to opensource](http://www.firsttimersonly.com)

> Contributing to open source for the first time can be scary and a little overwhelming. Perhaps you're a Code Newbie or maybe you've been coding for a while but haven't found a project you felt comfortable contributing to.

[Is Go on its way to become programming language of 2016?](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index//)

> Go has jumped from 65th to 16th on the TIOBE Index which is an EXTREMELY large jump. I think Go can be the de facto Open Source language.

[Ohio Linux Fest](https://ohiolinux.org) 

> Mat (Chasinglogic) Robinson talks about Ohio Linux Fest and gives us a little review of how his talk went. The guys also provide their review of Ohio Linux Fest, what was done well and what could be done better.
