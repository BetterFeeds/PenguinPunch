This week the guys cover topics all over the place. What do you think of the 
google pixel? Macbook owners are flocking to Opensource Hardware and Hack your 
car. Just some of the great topics covered in this episode.

[The Google Pixel is too dumb and ugly to replace your iphone](http://gizmodo.com/the-google-pixel-is-too-dumb-and-ugly-to-replace-your-i-1787877249)

> If you're like me, and have avoided the iPhone all these years, it's time to give in. The iPhone is definitively better this year. The current roster of flagship Android phones are a complete joke. The Galaxy S7 at least looks nice, but it's already more than six months old. If you must buy an Android phone, the Pixel makes a strong case. But I can no longer heartily endorse buying an Android, because if this is the best phone available, it's time to move on.

[Corrode Making Progress On Translating C To Rust](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Corrode-C-To-Rust)

> Jamey Sharp, the developer known for some of his past contributions to X.Org, has been hacking a lot lately on his latest project: Corrode. This project is about automatically converting C source files into Rust.
>
> Corrode is able to convert C code into Rust, but so far is able to perform just basic operations automatically and doesn't yet take full advantage of Rust's potential. Corrode is designed to help with partial automation of legacy code into Rust and as a new/complementary approach for static analysis of C programs. Corrode is going along so well that Mozilla has begun sponsoring Jamey's work with Mozilla continuing to spearhead Rust's development.

[There is no Open Source business model.](https://medium.com/@stephenrwalli/there-is-no-open-source-business-model-cdc4cc20238#.4er5iuhxb)

> I believe open source licensed, disciplined, collaborative development communities will prove to be the best software development and maintenance methodology over the long term. It's created a myriad of robust adaptive building blocks that have become central to modern life in a world that runs on software. But folks should never confuse the creation of those building blocks with the underlying business of solving customer problems in a marketplace. There is no “open source business model.”

[Some Disappointed Apple Fans Are Moving To Ubuntu Linux](https://fossbytes.com/system76-laptop-apple-replacement/)

> Thanks to technology enthusiasts' underwhelming response to Apple's October event, a big flock of users turned to the famed Ubuntu laptop seller System76 whose website witnessed about 4-times more traffic than usual. As a result, System76 needed to upgrade the servers to keep up. It could be seen as a sign that users are looking at Linux machines as Mac-alternatives.

[The Price of the GPL](http://bitsplitting.org/2016/10/30/the-price-of-gpl/)

> The price of GPL is fairly obvious and easy to understand, even if there is some bickering about what constitutes “linked code.” You don't have to be a legal expert to get the gist of it: if you want to link your software with GPL code, you must also make your software's source code available. Specifically, you must make your software's source code available to customers who install your software, under a GPL-compatible license. You have to give your code away. That's the price of GPL.

[Solus 1.2.1 Officially Released, First MATE Edition Now Available for Download](http://news.softpedia.com/news/solus-1-2-1-officially-released-first-mate-edition-now-available-for-download-509435.shtml)

> Today, October 19, 2016, Softpedia was informed by the Solus Project about the official release and general availability of the long-anticipated Solus 1.2.1 release, along with the first Solus MATE Edition.
>
> Solus 1.2.1 is shipping with the Budgie 10.2.8 desktop environment, which includes full IBus (Intelligent Input Bus) support for enabling multi-lingual input, a new Places Indicator for quick access to your most used folders and drives, improvements to the on-screen display (OSD) notifications for sound and brightness, a popover for the volume applet, and countless other small, yet useful enhancements.

[Fedora is pioneering switchable graphics on Linux](https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2016/11/01/discrete-graphics-and-fedora-workstation-25/)

> There are for sure some things that will not be ready in time for Fedora Workstation 25, for instance if you want to use the binary NVidia driver we will not be able to make that work with XWayland. So native Wayland applications will be fine, including games using SDL on top of Wayland, but due to how the stack is architected we haven't gotten around to implementing bridging OpenGL from Xwayland down to the binary NVidia driver. With Nouveau it should work however. This corner case we will have to figure out for Fedora Workstation 26, but for now we have decided that if we detect a Optimus system we will default you to X instead of Wayland.

[It's Finally Legal To Hack Your Own Devices Even Your Car](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/hacking-car-pacemaker-toaster-just-became-legal/)

[Another Link](https://www.linux.com/news/its-finally-legal-hack-your-own-devices-even-your-car)

> Last Friday, a new exemption to the decades-old law known as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act quietly kicked in, carving out protections for Americans to hack their own devices without fear that the DMCA's ban on circumventing protections on copyrighted systems would allow manufacturers to sue them. One exemption, crucially, will allow new forms of security research on those consumer devices. Another allows for the digital repair of vehicles. Together, the security community and DIYers are hoping those protections, which were enacted by the Library of Congress's Copyright Office in October of 2015 but delayed a full year, will spark a new era of benevolent hacking for both research and repair.

[Ukuu – An Easy Way To Install And Upgrade Linux Kernel In Ubuntu-based Systems](https://www.ostechnix.com/ukuu-an-easy-way-to-install-and-upgrade-linux-kernel-in-ubuntu-based-systems/)

> Today, I have stumbled upon a simple, yet useful tool called “Ubuntu Kernel Upgrade Utility”, shortly Ukuu, that allows you to install and upgrade Linux kernel in Ubuntu-based systems. Ukuu is developed and maintained by Tony George of TeeJee Tech. It fetches the latest main line Linux kernel from kernel.ubuntu.com, and install it automatically in your Ubuntu. Whenever a new Kernel update is available, it will notify you. Ukuu is a Gtk GUI and command line tool, so it will work on both Desktop and Server editions.
>
> In this brief, I will explain how to install and upgrade latest Linux Kernel in Ubuntu 16.10 desktop. The same steps should work on other Ubuntu versions and Ubuntu derivatives such as Linux Mint, Elementary OS etc.

[Dear Microsoft](https://slackhq.com/dear-microsoft-8d20965d2849)

> Second, an open platform is essential. Communication is just one part of what humans do on the job. The modern knowledge worker relies on dozens of different products for their daily work, and that number is constantly expanding. These critical business processes and workflows demand the best tools, regardless of vendor.
>
> That's why we work so hard to find elegant and creative ways to weave third-party software workflows right into Slack. And that's why there are 750 apps in the Slack App Directory for everything from marketing automation, customer support, and analytics, to project management, CRM, and developer tools. Together with the thousands of applications developed by customers, more than six million apps have been installed on Slack teams so far.
>
> We are deeply committed to making our customers' experience of their existing tools even better, no matter who makes them. We know that playing nice with others isn't exactly your MO, but if you can't offer people an open platform that brings everything together into one place and makes their lives dramatically simpler, it's just not going to work.

## The Deep Dive
[Do Opensource Projects need to work together to survive](https://www.linux.com/news/open-source-projects-must-work-together-survive)

> *"The problem open source faces is that the projects are often fragmented and competing, and integration points with other projects aren't often considered early in their lifecycle."*
