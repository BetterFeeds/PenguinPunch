Support for Open Source Virtual Reality hardware – an initiative known as OSVR, which allows a wide range of hardware manufacturers and developers to contribute to a open VR ecosystem for Windows PC, Linux and Mac– is finally coming to Steam officially.

Today’s announcement means that OSVR supported content is now visible on the Steam Store alongside content made specifically for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Users can now sort via preferred supported platform within the store and a special OSVR badge will be displayed alongside the other platforms within the store interface.

### [Email client that doesn't suck, and supports exchange!](http://ivelope.com/invite/LinuxTux) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@chasinglogic](https://twitter.com/chasinglogic)</small>

I’ve been spending this past year building an email client designed to save you time, with a bunch of new features when /u/NLZ13 and /u/pyr02k1 pointed out that there weren’t really any good email clients for Linux, so I’m releasing the email client for Linux also!

Here’s an invite for the beta: http://ivelope.com/invite/LinuxTux
  
Ask me about what features you would like in an email client for Linux, or ask me anything!

### [Should you go with a rolling release Linux? 5 Reasons to consider.](http://www.pcworld.com/article/3133030/linux/5-reasons-to-opt-for-a-linux-rolling-distro-vs-a-standard-release.html) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@pylogix](https://twitter.com/pylogix)</small>

1. All the latest software without the compiling
2. You’ll get support for newer hardware faster
3. There are no prompts for version upgrades
4. Say goodbye to packages made for a specific OS version
5. Have your source and compile it too

### [Microsoft Loves Linux Patent Tax](http://techrights.org/2016/11/22/microsoft-loves-linux-patent-tax/) <small style="font-size: 16px">[@secureshellv2](https://twitter.com/secureshellv2)</small>

SOFTWARE PATENTS are still possible to attain at the USPTO, but this does not mean — and is certainly no guarantee — that courts or even boards (like PTAB) will tolerate these. In fact, both often reject these and this reduces the incentive to pursue software patents in the first place.

Watchtroll offers tips for overcoming the barriers to software patenting, having come to grips with the fact that at the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) almost no software patents survive (one can count this year’s exceptions on the fingers of one hand).
