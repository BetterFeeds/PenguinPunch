About PenguinPunch
PenguinPunch is a podcast produced by three friends with a love of computers and Linux. Really you could say all things open source. Each member of this odd, but funny team brings thier own professinal and personal experice to the podcast to make it informative but fun to listen to.  

Justin Snyder the host of the show has the least amount of experience with Linux but makes it fun as he is quick to question the other two members of the team. 
​
Mat Robinson is the developer of the bunch who prides himself on developing and contributing to opense source projects. He is also a source of info for all things programming and knows a little bit about linux as well. 
​
Jason Crosby is the System Administrator of the group. He brings pratical knowlege and the most experience with linux. When Jaosn talks the other two.... well they try to listen but it is just to much fun to make fun of Jason.
