# About The Podcast

PenguinPunch is a podcast produced by three friends with a love of Linux and
all things Open Source. There are 27 years of Linux experience between all
members of the podcast and, like most FOSS community members, rarely agree on
anything. Listen to this podcast to hear the team hashing out issues in the
FOSS community today where all of the major viewpoints in FOSS are represented, 
The Developer, The Crusty Old Sys Admin, and the Newb.
